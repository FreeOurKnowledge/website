There are multiple ways you can get involved with the project, beyond pledging to campaigns and sharing them with your friends and colleagues. New campaigns are currently being developed on our [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues). If you see something there that you're interested in, please add any feedback you might have and a 'thumbs up' to show which campaigns are likely to get traction. Or, if you have an idea for a campaign that hasn't been proposed, feel free to propose it by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose).

Here are some other ways you can contribute:

*Donate/share our crowdfunding campaign*. We are a researcher-driven initiative and currently 100% self-funded. If you can afford a few dollars to sponsor our platform development, or would be willing to share to your networks, please do so [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test). 

*Ambassadors*. We're looking for people who can help spread the word to friends and colleagues within their institutions and research fields (e.g. via presentations, social media, and casual discussions). 

*Communications and marketing*. We're looking for skilled communicator/s who can help spread the word about this project (e.g. via social media, blogs, articles, and advertising).

*Software development*. There's plenty to do on both the front- and back-end software development, please get in touch if you have skills in this department.

*UX design*. The current platform is in a minimal viable product state, and we're looking for collaborators to help redesign and develop the user experience (coded in Jekkyl for Github Pages). 

*Metascience*. As the data comes in, it will be useful to analyse it along various dimensions to gauge community support (e.g. researcher career-level, country, institution, etc.). These analyses will then be displayed on the website and contribute to publications and blogs describing the platform usage.

*Data management*. We're anticipating collecting large numbers of pledges with this project and need to keep that information confidential but also amenable to various analyses. As such, we're looking for people with experience organising and securing confidential data.
