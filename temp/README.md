# Free Our Knowledge: Community-building repository and discussion forum

Hi! Thanks for dropping by. Welcome to the open research revolution :)

### About the project
Open research practices have the potential to benefit the entire research community, but could be perceived by some researchers as a threat to their career under the ‘publish-or-perish’ paradigm. For example, the widespread sharing of data and code could allow researchers to validate and build on each others’ work more efficiently, thus saving countless hours of duplicated effort, but some individuals may worry that doing so will place them at a competitive disadvantage. Similarly, the widespread support for platinum open access systems could drastically decrease publication costs and place the control of scholarly communication in the hands of the research community, but individuals may worry that these outlets do not confer sufficient prestige to ensure their survival in a competitive job market. Problems like these -- in which groups of individuals fail to reach a preferable state due to conflicting personal interests -- are known as [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem)) and can often be resolved by organising a critical mass of individuals to take action in a coordinated manner ('collective action'; Olson, 1965). Despite the increasing use of the internet to organise collective action on a global scale, however (e.g., Kickstarter, Collaction), the global research community has yet to embrace collective action as a potential catalyst for positive cultural change in academia. 

At Project Free Our Knowledge (FOK), we're building the world's first collective action platform for the research community. Our [website]((https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) lets researchers signal their intentions to adopt progressive research behaviours *if and when there is a pre-determined level of support in the community*. Pledges remain inactive and anonymised until this time, allowing vulnerable individuals to signal their desire for positive culture change without risk to their career. Then -- after the critical mass is met -- all signatories are de-anonymised on the website and directed to carry out the action together, thus creating momentum for change and protecting each other's interests through collective action. We anticipate that over time, these campaigns will grow increasingly larger in size and scope, and eventually become a powerful driving force in aligning the academic system with the needs of research community and principles of science itself.

### Project structure
Project FOK is divided into two separate repositories:
* (1) a ['platform' repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/platform), which is for developing the code behind the [website](https://www.freeourknowledge.org/) (you probably don't need to look at that repo unless you're a developer or project admin)
* (2) this 'community' repository, which is for storing documents (e.g., marketing materials) and organising discussions (including the design of new campaigns, using the [Issues feature](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/documentation/issues/new/choose))
