## The pledge: 

As a researcher who works in or relates to the field of cognitive science, I agree that the profiteering by third parties in the current publishing system in academia is highly problematic (for a problem analysis see here), and therefore I am willing to declare that:

I will publish 1 of my first-authored papers with an open access journal that does not charge article processing fees (i.e., under a diamond open access agreement) within 5 years if 500 other cognitive science researchers pledge to do the same

__If and only if the following conditions are met:__

That it is ensured that my pledge will not be made public without my permission if the pledge does not activate. When the pledge activates my pledge becomes automatically public, and I will be notified at this point.


### What is Diamond Open Access
[Diamond open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access) refers to publishers that do not ask for payment for publishing their research articles from the reader, nor ask for payment from the author (or their institution) via so-called article processing fees (APCs). This is possible for example through journals that are led by universities themselves via their associated university press labels  (e.g., see MIT Press’s journal [OpenMind](https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/pages/submission-guidelines)), or by scientific societies.

### Where can I publish then?
There is a comprehensive database of open-access journals that do not charge article processing fees, called the Directory of Open Access Journals ([DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)). Via this database one can query open access journals that do not charge article processing fees (i.e., Diamond Open Access). For example, see a list for fields that are known to contribute to topics in cognitive science related:

### Why have a threshold for the pledge to activate?
Acting together with a significant proportion of fellow researchers engaged in topics of cognitive science ensures two important things. You will not seem less competitive by choosing not to publish in prestigious for-profit journals, since your decision will be part of a larger scale and more well-known initiative. Additionally, you will be sure of your actions truly having a large impact, from the moment the covenant commences, with so many others alongside you, fostering a more collaborative research community. 

Of course, it is not necessary to wait until the covenant to activate before publishing with non-profit publishers, and we expect that some researchers will also choose to enact the covenant even before it becomes formally active. The threshold and the wording of the covenant have been chosen to be achievable while still ensuring a widespread impact. 

### Why 500 signees?
It is difficult to have a well-motivated threshold for cognitive science, as it is a loose-knit community. The larger commitment is, the more inertia will be for the community to adopt said commitment. However since the demand of the pledge is fairly modest, we chose a threshold that indicates a shared commitment. 

### What does it mean to publish one of my first authored papers under diamond open access?
If over a period over 5 years you publish N amount of papers. At least one of them is published under a diamond open access agreement. If you have not published any papers, then the pledge will not need to be ratified.

### What about my supervisor?
We recommend discussing the signing of this covenant with your supervisor to prevent conflicts of interest.

### I am a senior researcher who rarely publishes first-authored papers. So why would I sign?
We strongly recommend signing the covenant so that you indicate your support of this initiative. By signing the covenant, we also ask you as a senior researcher to encourage early career researchers to sign the pledge. Note further that when senior researchers publish first-authored papers they tend to publish authoritative theoretical and opinion pieces which will have enormous impact if they are increasingly published with non-profit publishers.

### Why cognitive science?
We think it is ideal to start collective action in a loose-knit interdisciplinary community, with many connections to other fields, which we hope can serve as a stepping stone for further initiatives academia-wide. Focusing on one field, rather than all of academia, means that if you sign the pledge, you are assured that you will be supported by a substantial body of fellow researchers in the same field as you. Additionally, we believe that engaging the community will be crucial to the success of a pledge such as this, and choosing a specific field such as cognitive science makes it possible to focus on a specific community to enga

### What if this project fails, for whatever reason?
While this initiative can fail by not reaching the threshold, it will be a message to the scientific publishing community that researchers are trying to take action. It seems that researchers are failing abysmally in taking collective action, be it for improving work conditions, or for improving the way we spend public resources. Even a failed attempt at collective action would signal a change in the spirit of the times.
